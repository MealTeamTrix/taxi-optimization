# Q-Learning Agent for FrozenLake

This project implements a Q-Learning agent to solve OpenAI Gym's `FrozenLake-v1` environment using a simple tabular method and epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.

## Features

- Tabular Q-learning with dynamic epsilon decay
- Epsilon-greedy exploration
- Policy derivation from Q-table
- Visualization of agent performance

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
